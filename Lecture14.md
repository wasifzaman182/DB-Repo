# Types of Databases
		
		# 1. Relational Databases
			1. Relational databases are one of the most popular database technologies used today. They are known for their flexibility, scalability, and reliability. 
			   Here are some of the best points about relational databases:

			# 1.Flexibility: 
				--> Relational databases are very flexible and can be used to store a wide variety of data. 
				--> They can be used to store data for everything from small businesses to large enterprises.
				
			# 2.Scalability:
				--> Relational databases are scalable and can handle large amounts of data. They can also be scaled up or down to meet the needs of the business.
			
			# 3.Reliability:
     			--> Relational databases are reliable and can handle a lot of traffic. They are also designed to prevent data corruption.
			
			# 4.SQL support: 
				--> Relational databases support the SQL (Structured Query Language) programming language. SQL is a standard language that is used to query and manage data in relational databases.
			
			**However, relational databases also have some bad points. Here are a few of them:

			# Complexity: 
				--> Relational databases can be complex to set up and manage. They require skilled database administrators to keep them running smoothly.
			
			# Performance:
				--> Relational databases can be slow for some types of queries. This is especially true for queries that involve complex joins.
			
			# Cost: 
				--> Relational databases can be expensive to purchase and maintain. They require powerful hardware and software to run.
			
			**Here are some tips for choosing the right database for your needs:

			# Consider the type of data you need to store: 
				--> If you need to store a lot of data or complex data, then a relational database may be a good choice.
			# Consider the performance requirements: 
				--> If you need a database that can handle complex queries quickly, then a relational database may not be the best choice.
			# Consider your budget:
				--> Relational databases can be expensive to purchase and maintain. If you are on a tight budget, then you may want to consider a different type of database.
	
	
	
		# 2. Object Oriented Databases
			
			--> Object-oriented databases (OODBs) are a type of database that stores data in the form of objects. 
			--> Objects are self-contained entities that contain data and behavior. OODBs are well-suited for storing complex data structures and relationships between data.

			**Here are some of the advantages of OODBs:

			# 1.naturales data modeling:
				--> OODBs store data in the form of objects, which is a natural way to model many types of data. This makes it easy to design and maintain OODB databases.
			
			# 2.Flexibility: 
				--> OODBs are very flexible and can be used to store a wide variety of data. They can also be used to support a wide variety of applications.
			
			# 3.Scalability: 
				--> OODBs are scalable and can handle large amounts of data. They can also be scaled up or down to meet the needs of the business.
			
			# 4.Performance: 
				--> OODBs can be very performant for certain types of queries, such as queries that involve complex relationships between data.
			
			**However, OODBs also have some disadvantages:

			# Complexity: 
				--> OODBs can be complex to set up and manage. They require skilled database administrators to keep them running smoothly.
			
			# Maturity: 
				--> OODBs are not as mature as relational databases. This means that there are not as many tools and resources available for OODBs.
			
			# Cost:
				--> OODBs can be expensive to purchase and maintain. They require powerful hardware and software to run.
			
		
		# 3. NoSQL Databases
			--> NoSQL databases are a type of database that does not follow the traditional relational model. 
			--> Instead, NoSQL databases store data in a variety of different ways, depending on the specific type of database.
		
			**Some of the most common types of NoSQL databases include:

			# 1.Document databases: 
			--> Document databases store data in the form of documents. Documents can be anything from a simple JSON object to a complex XML document.
			
			# 2.Key-value databases:
			--> Key-value databases store data in the form of key-value pairs. Keys are unique identifiers, and values can be anything from a simple string to a complex object.

			# 3.Wide-column databases: 
			--> Wide-column databases store data in the form of columns. Columns can be of different types, and they can contain any type of data.
			
			# 4.Graph databases: 
			--> Graph databases store data in the form of graphs. Graphs are made up of nodes and edges, and nodes can contain any type of data.
            
            **Here are some of the advantages of NoSQL databases:

			# 1.Performance: 
				-->NoSQL databases can be very performant for certain types of queries. This is because NoSQL databases are not constrained by the relational model.
			
			# 2.Scalability: 
				--> NoSQL databases are scalable and can handle large amounts of data. They can also be scaled up or down to meet the needs of the business.
			# 3.Flexibility: 
				--> NoSQL databases are very flexible and can be used to store a wide variety of data. They can also be used to support a wide variety of applications.
			
			**However, NoSQL databases also have some disadvantages:

			# Complexity: 
				--> NoSQL databases can be complex to set up and manage. They require skilled database administrators to keep them running smoothly.
			
			# Consistency: 
			    --> NoSQL databases may not be as consistent as relational databases. This means that there may be a chance that data could be lost or corrupted.
			
			# Maturity:
			    --> NoSQL databases are not as mature as relational databases. This means that there are not as many tools and resources available for NoSQL databases.
			
	
		# 4. Hierarchical Databases
			1. As the name suggests, the hierarchical database model is most appropriate for use cases in which the main focus of information gathering is based on a concrete 
			   hierarchy, such as several individual employees reporting to a single department at a company.
		
		
		# 5. Network Databases
			1. Extension of Hierarchical databases
			2. The child records are given the freedom to associate with multiple parent records.
			3. Organised in a Graph structure.
			4. Can handle complex relations.
			5. Maintenance is tedious.
			6. M:N links may cause slow retrieval.
			7. Not much web community support.
			8. e.g., Integrated Data Store (IDS), IDMS (Integrated Database Management System),
				Raima Database Manager, TurboIMAGE etc.
